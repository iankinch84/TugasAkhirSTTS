About:
TFN Server and Client
ICMP-Controlled remote udp/syn/icmp/smurf flood network

Installation:
1) Read and edit config.h
2) Type 'make'

Usage:
Install the server 'td' on a number of hosts. Put all IP
addresses of the hosts running the server into a list; this
will be your iplist.
Run the client 'tfn' from anywhere, using the iplist as first
parameter. You can use the following request types:

-2 <bytes>         set packet size for packets used for udp/icmp/smurf attacks
-1 <mask>          set spoof mask. 0 will use random ips, 1 uses the correct
                   class a, 2 correct class b and 3 correct class c ip value
0                  stop current floods; if no floods are found, display status
1 <targets>        udp flood. target is one ip or multiple ips separated by @
2 <targets> <port> syn flood. if port is 0, random ports are used.
3 <targets>        icmp echo request flood.
4 <port>           only if compiled with ID_SHELL. bind a rootshell to <port>
5 <target@bcasts>  smurf amplifier icmp attack. unlike the above floods,
                   this only supports a single target. further ips separated
                   by @ will be used as smurf amplifier broadcast addresses
